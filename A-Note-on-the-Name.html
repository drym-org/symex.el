<p>Symex was originally a tool for editing Lisp code, although it can be used with many languages, now.
</p>
<p>Lisp has inherited a few oddball names from its deep prehistory, including the infamous <code class="code">car</code> and <code class="code">cdr</code> for the first and the rest of the <a class="uref" href="https://www.blogbyben.com/2011/04/best-bumper-sticker-ever.html">elements in a list</a>. But S-expression / sex-puh / symbolic expression — referring to the makeup of Lisp syntax — are all somewhat of a mouthful, too. Here are a few reasons why we might consider using &quot;sym-ex&quot; instead:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>&quot;Symbolic expression&quot;: 6 syllables, long in written form too.

</li><li>&quot;S-expression&quot;: 4 syllables, and confusing at least partially because it is a single-letter acronym, which is unusual. In addition, it is long in written form.

</li><li>&quot;Sexpuh&quot; / &quot;sex-p&quot; / &quot;sexpr&quot;: 2 syllables, short in written form. But I mean, these are terrible.

</li><li>&quot;s-ex&quot;: Speaks for itself.

</li><li>&quot;Symex&quot;: 2 syllables, short in written form, has normal linguistic analogues like &quot;complex/complexes,&quot; and it&rsquo;s fun to say! Symex also sounds like Ibex, and that&rsquo;s obviously a plus.
</li></ul>
