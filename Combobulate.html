<p>Combobulate is similar to Symex in its aims to be precise and intuitive. It differs in the style of interface and the feature set, providing a lot more grammar-aware and IDE-like features than Symex does. Symex has a minimal interface and offers more diverse features for elementary structural manipulation.
</p>
<p>Ultimately, while there is some overlap in features, there&rsquo;s also a lot offered by each that&rsquo;s not present in the other, so that it might make sense to use one and cherry-pick features from the other. For instance, to employ specific Combobulate features from Symex, you could use a similar recipe as <a class="ref" href="Symex-and-Evil.html">Symex and Evil</a>. It may also be feasible to integrate them more at a library level. As part of the 2.0 release, Symex &mdash; a formerly monolithic package &mdash; was decomposed into small and modular packages in order to facilitate such goals.
</p>
<p>Combobulate is thoughtfully designed and sophisticated, and may be a good fit for you. Try both and see which one (or both!) fits your style better!
