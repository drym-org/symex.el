<p>Typically, when executing traversals, we only need to know whether a traversal succeeded or failed. For this purpose, it&rsquo;s sufficient to check whether the traversal evaluates to a non-<code class="code">nil</code> result in order to infer success.
</p>
<p>But there are cases when you may need to modulate the computation being performed as part of the traversal. For instance, the &ldquo;leap&rdquo; feature in Symex computes a delta of each position in relation to the initial position, as it traverses, and stops traversing when the delta reaches <code class="code">0</code> in both <code class="code">x</code> (horizontal position along branch) and <code class="code">y</code> (height from root) directions.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this section explains how computations work, so that you can write similar traversals that may need to perform custom computations.
</p>
<p>Symex executes traversals while evaluating an associated &ldquo;fold&rdquo;-like computation. By default, that computation simply assembles a sequence of the moves made during traversal evaluation, producing this full list as the result.
</p>
<p>The computation is specified in terms of a &ldquo;perceiving&rdquo; operation that represents the underlying move (every traversal is ultimately composed of elementary moves) in a way that is relevant for the computation, and a &ldquo;synthesizing&rdquo; operation that combines the accumulated result with the new perceived input.
</p>
<p>Traversals may be evaluated with arbitrary computations that are specified in this way. The in-progress result is always available to traversals as an argument, so that they may condition on this in-progress result (as &ldquo;leap&rdquo; does, stopping when a condition on the result is met).
</p>
<p>For example, the following computation simply counts the number of moves made during traversal evaluation:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(defvar my-symex-compute-moves
        (symex-make-computation :perceive (lambda (_x) 1)
                                :synthesize #'+)
</pre></div>

<p>It may be used as follows:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(symex-eval (symex-traversal
              (circuit (move forward)))
            my-symex-compute-moves)
</pre></div>

<p>This counts the number of moves made in traversing forward to the end of the containing expression.
</p>
<p>Note that traversals sometimes return &ldquo;zero&rdquo; moves, that is, <code class="code">(move 0 0)</code>, to indicate an intentional absence of movement, as opposed to <code class="code">nil</code> which indicates a failed traversal, so this computed result may return more moves than the actual number of steps taken. It is just an example of a simple computation, though, perhaps, not a very useful one.
