<p>Typical cursor movements in Emacs navigate the two-dimensional plane of buffer rows and columns, so that left, right, up and down mean moving by column and by row, respectively. This is a very general way of moving around that you can use for any kind of text, including code.
</p>
<p>Symex motions are more specialized and navigate the two-dimensional tree structure of your code, so that left and right move to adjacent expressions, and up and down move across nesting depth. When you&rsquo;re working with code, this is more precise, and often, therefore, more efficient and more scalable.
</p>
<p>In addition to these basic motions, Symex also provides many other ways to get around that are intuitive for trees but which don&rsquo;t have analogues for unstructured, coordinate-based buffer navigation. For instance, &ldquo;traversing&rdquo; forwards and backwards visits every expression at every depth, precisely and in a predictable order, while &ldquo;skipping,&rdquo; &ldquo;climbing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;descending&rdquo; offer ways to get around faster in specific directions when you know where you&rsquo;re trying to go. Finally, you can also &ldquo;leap&rdquo; to nearby branches at the same height as your current position without explicitly navigating to them. This is very common as code frequently has repeating shapes and patterns &mdash; patterns which you may wish to exploit to get around quickly or even for automating repetitive tasks via macros.
