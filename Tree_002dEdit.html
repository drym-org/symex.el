<p><a class="uref" href="https://github.com/ethan-leba/tree-edit">Tree-Edit</a> was one of the first packages to offer structural editing for non-Lisp languages via Tree-sitter. It is composed of two packages. First, a core library containing a reasoning engine built on top of tree-sitter, along with commands for structural and templated editing. And another package for an evil state that leverages these features in a user interface. The latter provides a &ldquo;point-free&rdquo; editing experience similar to Symex.
</p>
<p>While there is some overlap in functionality at the UI level, the core features offered by the packages are fairly distinct, and it&rsquo;s likely that they could be leveraged by either package, someday.
</p>
<p>For instance, Symex provides a very basic set of insertion commands. &ldquo;Inserting after&rdquo; an <code class="code">if</code> block in Symex would just put the cursor at the right spot and leave the rest to you, but Tree-Edit would wrap the insertion point with <code class="code">else</code>! On the other hand, Symex provides a rich array of traversals via the DSL, which Tree-Edit doesn&rsquo;t have today.
</p>
<p>For most other packages on this list, it&rsquo;s easy to use them together with Symex, but for Tree-Edit, as it, too, is modal, using them together may not be straightforward. It likely makes a lot more sense to integrate these packages at the library level, which we hope to explore.
