;;; Commentary:

;; Primitive navigations using third party libraries.  This layer of primitives
;; can be swapped out without changing the higher-level functionality provided
;; by the Symex DSL.  In the future it may make sense to directly operate on
;; an annotated representation of the AST here containing a mapping to buffer
;; positions and other metadata relevant for editing purposes.
